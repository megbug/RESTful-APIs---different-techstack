# RESTful-APIs---different-techstack

This repo is supposed to become a collection of RESTful APIs implemented with various technologies.
For me it's easier to learn and understand new concepts better by experimenting and applying them practically.

You might wonder why I'm exploring different tech stacks, tools and technologies.
Here is **why**:

- with every tech stack having its own strength, one can pick and choose what works best or better for specific projects/tasks
- the tech world keeps evolving, learning the basics of various tools and technologies helps with staying ahead and evolving alongside it
- gaining a broader perspective on technology and problem solving in general

I'm not saying that one should try and master all of the various tech stacks available - is that even possible?
It's just about a little basic knowledge.
